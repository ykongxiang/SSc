SSc referenced data (all from GEo database)
【1】	RNA sequencing and differential expression analyses were performed to identify differentially expressed genes in SSc lung pericytes as compared to normal. 
      GSE222552（4，3）bulk
【2】	Human scleroderma skin derived fibroblast were treated with LiCL. This is a study of differential gene expression between LiCl treated SSc group and untreated SSc group. 
      GSE254716（5，5）bulk
【3】	We conducted a population scale single-cell genomic analysis of skin and blood samples of 56 healthy controls, and 97 SSc patients at different stages of disease. 
      GSE195452（26，97）scRNA
【4】	Analysis of lung fibroblasts isolated from biopsies, taken at the time of diagnosis, from patients with well-defined pulmonary fibrosis associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc-ILD). Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the fibrotic fibroblast phenotype in SSc-ILD.
      GDS4995（10，8，3）bulk
【5】	Single cell RNA sequencing and spatial sequencing on human scleroderma skin tissues. 
      GSE249279 scRNA
【6】	We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on explanted lung tissue of patients with SSc-PH (n=16), idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH, n=3) and healthy controls (n=15).
      GSE244781 scRNA
